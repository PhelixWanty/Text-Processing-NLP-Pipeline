Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to work with human language. Modern systems can classify emails, translate text, summarize documents, and answer questions. Still, language is messy: the same word can have different meanings, punctuation is inconsistent, and social media includes slang.

A practical NLP pipeline often starts with sentence segmentation and tokenization. Next, it assigns each token a part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.). After that, a lemmatizer reduces inflected forms to a base form (e.g., 'running' -> 'run'). Finally, stop words (like 'the' and 'is') may be removed to keep mostly content words. The quality of each step affects later steps, so testing on longer text is important.
